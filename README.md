📦 Product CRUD with JWT Authentication  
Personal project developed to consolidate knowledge in Spring Boot, Spring Security, and JWT (JSON Web Token) by creating a REST API for product management with user validation.

📚 About the Project  
This REST API enables CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products.  
The application’s security is implemented using JWT tokens, ensuring that only authenticated users can access or manipulate the data.

🚀 Features  
📦 Create new products (POST)  

📋 List all products or retrieve by ID (GET)  

✏️ Update product information (PUT)  

❌ Delete products (DELETE)  

🔒 User authentication with login and JWT generation  

🔐 Endpoint protection using Spring Security
